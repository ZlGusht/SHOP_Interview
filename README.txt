The project was made using the new (for me at least) Blazor technology that was introduced.
I used to work with Razor, which was really frustrating, but the new addition might give people second thoughts about using a js based framework.
I adore working with front-end frameworks like Angular and thought I should give the long waited .NET feature a try.
It took me longer than expected, but finally I made it.
It follows the traditional viewmodel, or as it is called now, the pagemodel, structure, passing the data to the page through it.
I could have used an InMemory database, but for simplicity's sake I did not.
The mechanism is fairly simple - every area of a grid is bound to the product type, the well-known scheme used in Angular for example.
Also used bootstrap to further simplify the stylizing.
The project aims to displaya list of products with a straight-forward, but still modern, approach.
